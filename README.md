# Embedded_Project

This project consists of multiple different files intended to be uploaded to a Texas Instruments MSP-430FR5994 microcrontroller. The included code, coupled with the proper hardware, allows a differential drive robot to be both remotely controlled (using a Wifi TCP/IP controller) and autonomously operated. When operating autonomously, the robot will follow a black line until it recieves a commend to do otherwise. Refer to comments in the individual source code files themselves for more detailed information.
